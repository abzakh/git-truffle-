The following sections will include an explanation of the data that will be utilized, data sources, the methodology followed and the analysis that was carried out and finally the conclusion and discussion section."

More interestingly, even at the level of the items within the cluster it appears that there is some sort of variation that will probably need further investigation, e.g. looking more closely at the nature of the neighborhoods and trying to understand what they are like in reality, one assumption to answer this and yet to be validated, is that the neihborhoods in this cluster are new and are not really well defined yet. Moreover, one can look at the variation when adding more most common venues (i.e. 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc...), which will ultimately help to see whether the variation continues, or we actually start to see more harmony as we add more venue categories.\n\nUltimately, the decision as to where a person can open a certain shop or a restaurant is left to the reader, given that the logical backing of where to choose is dependent on the incumbent of the decision. Put differently, there is the opinion of opening a restaurant for example in a neighborhood known to have restaurants as its most common venue category, with the logical backing that more people will be visiting that venue for its restaurants and that would most probably increase the chance of the newly opened restaurant gaining attraction. The flip side to that coin is, an area with less restaurants will be more likely profitable for the business since little to no one will be competing. \n\nAnd while both arguments are correct in certain different conditions, the specifics behind making such decisions are studied differently rather than assumed, e.g. studying the markets for each cluster from a supply/demand matching perspective. This is however, out of the scope of what this recommender system tries to achieve."

Secondly, getting the lats/longs for these nieghborhoods/clusters which helped in merging the resultant dataframe with the data pulled from foresquare API in the third step. After which the data was put into a k-means clustering algorithm to reduce it into buckets of similar nature. Finally, the recommender system was built based on the most common venue categories in each cluster using the concept of the Pareto distribution.\n\nFuture developlment can be made to automate the process even further for those who want the machine to pick the neighborhood for them when opening a certain shop or a business, by further studying the economics and/or the urban aspects of those clusters"
