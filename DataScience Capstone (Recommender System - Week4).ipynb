This should ultimately help those who are seeking to open a shop/restaurant/etc. and are in search for a rough estimate as to which neighborhood will be the best fit.\n\nThe recommender system will present multiple venue categories in each cluster and will leave the choice to the person in interest to select the cluster that best suit their purpose. \n\nThe project will be utilizing two main data science approaches (k-means clustering and recommender systems) in order to end up with the desired results. The following sections will include an explanation of the data that will be utilized, data sources, the methodology followed and the analysis that was carried out and finally the conclusion and discussion section."
